It's hard to stay still in the development world, it seems like things are constantly moving and changing. Interesting new libraries and even languages are cropping up all the time. [^1] On top of that, I can't shake the feeling that there's already too much to learn and that I don't yet know enough. This usually means reading and writing code in my spare time; playing around with new languages and old ideas.

These things tend to pile up quickly.

I think what I'm trying to say is, I want this to be a place where I can show off all the things that are new to me, and maybe even new to you. I don't think I should keep my learning to myself â€“ it isn't nearly as fun. So let's be one of [the lucky 10 thousand](https://xkcd.com/1053/) together.

[^1]: My favorite new kids on the block being [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/).
