It's hard to stay still in the development world. Things are constantly moving and changing. Interesting new libraries and even languages are cropping up all the time. [^1] On top of that, I can't shake the feeling that there's already too much to learn and that I don't yet know enough. This usually means reading and writing code in my spare time; playing around with new languages and old ideas.

These things tend to pile up quickly.

I think what I'm trying to say is, I want this to be a place where I can show off all the things that are new to me, and maybe even new to you. I don't think I should keep my learning to myself. It isn't nearly as fun when it's done alone. So let's be one of the lucky 10 thousand together.
